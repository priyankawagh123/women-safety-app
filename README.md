# women-safety-app
A web-based safety app for women that enables real-time location sharing, SOS alerts, and emergency contact management. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it helps users quickly notify trusted contacts during emergencies via WhatsApp, SMS, or Email.
The app provides quick and efficient features that allow users to alert their trusted contacts when they feel unsafe.

 - Covers multiple safety dimensions: legal, physical, digital.

# Purpose:
- This project was created to raise awareness and offer practical safety solutions for women using web technologies. It showcases frontend development, API integration, and responsive design.
